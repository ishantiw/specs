*provide here guidelines to be used to develop IdP Proxies. Use [protostub dev](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs/blob/master/messaging-framework/stub-specification.md) as reference. The current [IdP Proxy template](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-protostubs/blob/master/src/idpproxy/ProxyStubTemplate.js) could also be useful.*
