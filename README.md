# reTHINK Framework Specifications

You'll find here the full detailed specification of reTHINK Framework

![reTHINK architecture](rethink-arch.png)

The reTHINK Framework is built around [Hyperlinked Entities (hyperties)](tutorials/hyperty.md) that communicates through a [Decentralised Communication Framework](messaging-framework/readme.md) leveraging the protocol-on-the-fly concept to enable full interoperability across domains without having to standardise network protocols. The reTHINK project envisages a global network of interconnected hyperties that are executed in web runtime environment on end-user devices or edge-network servers. The reTHINK Framework functions are based on a series of such hyperties that are generated by the service provider, and are downloaded to the users’ end-users or edge-network servers from a Catalogue that also contains metadata describing Hyperty business capabilities. The instantiated versions of these hyperties are registered in a Registry to become discoverable. Therefore, the Registry serves as a location manager and is used for user discovery. A user can be a human being, a group or, a connected object (e.g. building room with sensors). Users have independent identities that are maintained by Identity Providers (IdPs) that are independent organizations. The users’ identities are based on their personal and confidential data, which is verified by other solicited data, but such private information is only divulged under user-controlled privacy rules.


The specification contained in this repository are:

* [the decentralised communication framework specification](messaging-framework/readme.md) that is used to support hyperty communication across domains dramaticaly reducing standardisation efforts thanks to the protocol-on-the-fly concept and to the P2P Reporter-Observer pattern.
* [the runtime specification](runtime/readme.md) that is used to support Hyperties execution in multiple platforms including browsers, NodeJS and Smartphones.
* [the Message Node specification](msg-node) to support back-end based communication when P2P communication is not possible *should we move this inside the Messaging Framework?*
* [the trust and identity management specification](trust-management/readme.md) that supports fully secured and trustful communication among Hyperties by using independent Identity Providers, giving the user full control of his Identity and personal data.
* [the Quality of Service management specification](qos/readme.md) that supports quality of service on-demand (work in progress).
* [the specification on how to support multiparty / group communication](group-communication/readme.md)
* [the specification on how to interoperate with legacy services that are not compliant with reTHINK framework](legacy-interoperability/readme.md)
* [the service framework specification](service-framework/readme.md) that provides some libraries to facilitate the development of Hyperties compliant with the specs.

Transversal to these specs we have:  

* the Core Data Model defined in more human friendly [UML Class Diagrams](datamodel/core) and in more machine friendly [json-schema](schemas/json-schema/core) *probably we should provide more textual decription*
* the Data Object Model used by Hyperties to communicate each other, defined in more human friendly [UML Class Diagrams](datamodel/data-objects) and in more machine friendly [json-schema](schemas/json-schema/data-objects) *probably we should provide more textual decription*
* the detailed specification of [messages](messages) used to support the different framework procedures including hyperty deployment, hyperty registration, identity management, discovery, etc
* A [dynamic view](dynamic-view) on how the main framework procedures are performed through Message Sequence Charts including hyperty deployment, hyperty registration, identity management, discovery, etc

You can also find in this repo a set of [tutorials](tutorials/readme.md) to support the development of Hyperties, Apps and Message Nodes.

In order to setup your own reTHINK Framework, you should install the following components (docker images available):

-	the [Hyperty Catalogue](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-catalogue)
-	the [Hyperty Domain Registry](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-registry-domain)
-	any of the three available Message Nodes: the [Vertx Message Node](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-msg-node-vertx), [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) or [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/).
