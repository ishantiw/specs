*[source code](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-service-framework/blob/master/src/message-factory/MessageFactory.js)*

Hyperty discovery is performed through the Runtime Core Discovery component which is used to query about Hyperty instances and Data Objects according to different criteria including UserId, supported Scheme, Hyperty Resources and name.

The discovery results are returned as a DiscoveryObject that provides event handlers for registration status changes (`onLive` and `onDisconnected`).
