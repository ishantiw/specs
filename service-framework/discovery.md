Hyperty discovery is performed through the Runtime Registry which is used to query about Hyperty Registry entries containing its Hyperty Runtime URL, the P2P Handler Stub instance URL and the catalogue URL of P2P Requester Stub. A full dynamic view for discovery is provided [here](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs/tree/master/dynamic-view/discovery).
