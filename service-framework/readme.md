The reTHINK Service Framework provides a comprehensive set of APIs to support the development of Hyperties. These APIs are agnostic with respect to the underlying messaging node, modular in design, and to the widest degree agnostic to devices and their operating systems, such as Android, iOS, Raspberry PI, Linux, or Windows.

Hyperty developers only have to focus on a few APIs:

The [Messaging Framework Bus](bus.md) provides a simple API to send and receive messages.

The	[Syncher API](syncher.md) provides the main functionalities used by Hyperties enabling the synchronisation of data among Hyperties through the Reporter-Observer communication pattern.

The [Discovery API](discovery.md) allows the discovery of remote Hyperties or Data Objects by using different criteria.

The [Identity Manager library](identity-manager.md) retrieves information about Identities associated to Hyperties.
