### Future work
Future integration can consist in the adding of the negotiation between peers, to allow IdP restriction and security level to a conversation. This feature is described in [Corre et al. paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-60131-1_27) and is implemented for demonstration purpose, but not integrated in the core runtime.
