### Identity Management for the conference Hyperty

The goal of this README is to provide Identity Management specifications for the conference Hyperty involved in reTHINK WebRTC group communication. Furthermore, an ongoing discussions about these specs can be found here [Identity Management at NodeJS](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs/issues/17). Besides,in this issue more details and arguments can be found as well.

Today, the identity of user behind the conference hyperty is a static identity asserted locally on the runtimeUA.

Here are some points collected form previous issues on this topic :

* Remote API for administration purpose : Remotely manage Identity Tokens in the Identity Module, eg to expose some Identity Module API through a remote API.
* Browser Runtime admin GUI to manage identities in remote NodeJS servers.
